Auto Eater Mod
=================
This is a simple client mod to stop worrying about eating all the time, selecting the food and eating. It detects whenever the foodbar falls below a certain threshold, selects food in your hotbar, and starts eating, and selects back the slot you had. You can add items to a blacklist to prevent eating unwanted items.
